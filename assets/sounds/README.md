# Sound Assets

Place your sound files in this directory:

- `move.mp3` - Sound played when a piece moves
- `capture.mp3` - Sound played when a piece is captured

You can download free chess sound effects from:
- freesound.org
- zapsplat.com
- YouTube Audio Library

Make sure the files are in MP3 format and named exactly as listed above.

The SoundService in `lib/services/sound_service.dart` is configured to use these files.
